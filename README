Installing ZMap:

- Download ZMap source code from https://zmap.io/download.html
- xcode-select --install (maybe required)
- brew install pkg-config (maybe required)
- Install MacPorts from https://guide.macports.org/#installing.macports
- sudo port install gmp libdnet byacc flex gengetopt cmake
- brew install json-c (maybe required)
- brew link json-c (maybe required)
Run the following commands from the zmap directory:
- cmake -DENABLE_DEVELOPMENT=OFF
- make
- sudo make install
(I ran into error for this last step. The issue is here: https://github.com/zmap/zmap/issues/327. I fixed it deleting "/". Updated lines 2 and 6 of file InstallConfFiles.cmake by using "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}conf/blacklist.conf" and "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}conf/zmap.conf")

If all the above steps are successful and zmap gives an error "command not found":
	- Create a file "~/.bash_profile" if it does not exist
	- Add "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin" to the end of the file "~/.bash_profile" 
	- In terminal, run "source ~/.bash_profile"

For any installation issues, check here if anyone has already had the problem: https://github.com/zmap/zmap/issues
or post the problem.
